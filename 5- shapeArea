int solution(int n) {
    // reasoning: by looking at the shapes sideways, so that the bottom left side is now exactly the bottom, there are n rows of n length, and n-1 rows of n-1 length, multiplying these and then adding together will give the total area (number of longer rows * length of longer rows) + (number of shorter rows * length of shorter rows)
    int area = (n*n) + (n-1)*(n-1);
    
    return area;
